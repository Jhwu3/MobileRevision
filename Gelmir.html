				<p>You're rolling right along in Elden Ring, having potentially claimed three Great Runes: those of Godrick the Grafted, Renalla, Queen of the Full Moon, and Starscourge Radahn. Now it's time to head north to the portion of the continent where the Erdtree grows: the Altus Plateau.
				<br>
				<br>
				Eventually, your road will lead you to Leyndell, but stopping off at Volcano Manor gives you a chance to take control of another Great Rune before making your way to the Erdtree to attempt to claim the Elden Ring. Volcano Manor is controlled by Rykard, the last of Radagon and Rennala's children, who is actually one of the biggest opponents of the Golden Order in the Lands Between, in fact. Making your way to his home illuminates a lot more facets about the Golden Order's past, things that happened in the Shattering, and what awful things are continuing to take place in the Lands Between.
				<br>
				<br>
				As you make your way into Mt. Gelmir, you'll start to get an inkling of who Rykard is and the horrors he's unleashed in his realm. With Mt. Gelmir almost right beside Leyndell, Rykard's forces posed the greatest threat to the capital, and evidence of battles between the Leyndell armies and Mt. Gelmir's military--both completed and ongoing--can be found all the way up the mountain. Especially early on, you'll find the remnants of Leyndell forces pawing through the corpses; it almost looks like they're eating them.
				<br>
				<br>
				The blackened battlefields surrounding Mt. Gelmir and what's left of the Leyndell soldiers gives an idea of what kind of warfare Rykard raged against the capital. Some survivors have seemingly lost their minds; others have definitely succumbed to madness, taking on the burning yellow eyes of frenzy. As you climb higher, you'll find some more of the forces that Rykard employed against Leyndell, including Abductor Virgins, the Iron Maiden-like contraptions we first spotted roaming in the courtyard of Raya Lucaria. The whole area is covered in blood and ravaged by flame, with piles of burned corpses and crucified soldiers revealing that the clash between these two armies wasn't just about territory and power, but about ideology.
				<br>
				<br>
				Rykard ordered the atrocities you see because they're fundamental reflections of the person he is: the Lord of Blasphemy.

				<p>You eventually come across Rykard himself in a giant room filled with magma. Well, actually, first you find a giant snake--the God-Devouring Serpent. The lore suggests this is Eiglay, the serpent of blasphemy, whose temple you find not far from Rykard, complete with a huge snake skin hanging from its rafters. From all the lore in this area, we learn that when Rykard chose blasphemy, he really went all-in. He fed himself to the serpent, and in that way, joined with it, becoming something other than human.
				<br>
				<br>
				In the second phase of the fight, you realize that Rykard and the snake really are one and the same, with Rykard's face growing out of the snake's neck and his arms erupting from its body--he even reaches down its throat and draws his sword, the Blasphemous Blade. (Another interesting tidbit: Rykard's hands here look almost exactly like the disembodied hand-spiders you fight in Caria Manor, suggesting those might be his creation.) Fighting Rykard here reveals the truth of what Volcano Manor and the Recusant Tarnished: like Godrick did with grafting, Rykard is looking for powerful Tarnished that he can consume to strengthen himself. Any Recusants who have proven their power by killing enough other Tarnished are eventually sent to meet Rykard, who devours them and brings them into himself, part of his "family."
