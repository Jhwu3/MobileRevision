				<p>The journey to Leyndell first takes you across the Altus Plateau. Though the city and its outskirts are largely intact, there's a lot to pay attention to in the surrounding area as you make your way toward it, and the Shattering has definitely not spared this place.
				<br>
				<br>
				Before you head to the capital, you can explore some of the land around it, which presents some interesting information. A bridge that heads north over a darkened forest has been destroyed, possibly during the Shattering, given you can find the convoys you've seen throughout the Lands Between crushed among the wreckage. The forest is populated by death-spewing, worm-faced creatures, and is the site of several sets of ruins. It appears that Leyndell has more or less abandoned this area, and with the bridge destroyed, nobody from the capital is visiting the area to the north.
				<br>
				<br>
				The lands at the north end of the plateau are dotted with windmills, and if you make your way there, you'll discover some... interesting people. The Windmill Pastures surrounding them flank the village of Dominula. All through this area, you'll find strange women dancing and laughing contentedly, their faces stained with blood. They're not hostile unless you attack them, for the most part, but if you investigate the area, you'll find evidence of quite a few murders and a ghost that begs someone not to skin him.

				<p>Despite being an Omen, we find out that the true lord of Leyndell, as it stands post-Shattering, is Morgott. He may mostly hide himself from the public, but at the moment, he's the leader of the capital's military and the most senior of Marika's royal lineage. The "Omen King" is possibly the most powerful political leader in the Lands Between, with the strongest army and the strongest walls protecting him.
				<br>
				<br>
				You realize he looks exactly like Margit, and the situation with the Fell Omen starts to make more sense. Morgott seemingly stayed loyal to his family, despite being shunned and imprisoned as an Omen. His loyalty, it appears, was rewarded, allowing him to fight for the Golden Order as the champion known as the Fell Omen, maybe under an assumed name to hide his identity.
				<br>
				<br>
				When you finally face Morgott. You see the Omen King's true power when you face him; he wields a bunch of powerful Faith-based attacks that show off his dedication to the Greater Will and the Golden Order. Still, it wasn't enough to make him Elden Lord, which is what he reveals when you finally defeat him. In his last moments, Morgott, now shrunken and human-looking, his Omen strength gone, reveals that the way into the Erdtree is sealed. Morgott was never able to get inside to claim the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord. In fact, no one can, he says. Investigating yourself, you find that he's right: thorns cover the opening in the Erdtree that would allow you to enter it and claim the Elden Ring. There's no way through, and all your work has been for nothing.
