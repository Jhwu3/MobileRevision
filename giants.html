				<p>You've defeated Morgott and made your way to the Erdtree, only to discover the way forward is blocked. During your journey through Elden Ring, your goal has always been to make your way to the Erdtree and seize the title of Elden Lord, but even though you've acquired a number of Great Runes at this point, some force is still barring you from entering the tree and claiming what's yours. There's more to the story of what's going on with the Erdtree and the Elden Ring, but we won't discover it for some time. Right now, we have to figure out how to go forward, and the quest is about to take us to the lands of a people Marika and the Golden Order truly conquered: the Mountaintops of the Giants.
				<br>
				<br>
				When Marika first rose to godhood and took Godfrey as her Elden Lord, they waged war on the giants first. You can actually track Marika's path through the Lands Between based on where her churches are established, with the First Church of Marika found in the Mountaintops. The path winds south, with Limgrave and the Weeping Peninsula being the last places she took over. Leyndell might have existed before Marika showed up, but it seems very likely that she was responsible for fortifying the capital into a place of great strength, and it seems that its location and fortification could have been, at least in part, about walling off the path to the Mountaintops beyond. Even though Marika defeated the Fire Giants, she found she could never completely put out their flame, so she took precautions against it ever being used against the Erdtree. Some of those precautions are stated outright, but we can speculate that Leyndell itself is a precaution against anyone ever reaching the Mountaintops again. With the giants' defeat, the age of the Erdtree and Marika's rule could truly begin.

				<p>Eventually, you'll find the Giants' Forge, and the last Fire Giant, who guards it. Fighting this guy, you'll soon notice that he has a face on his chest, complete with one huge, frightening eye. This is the eye of the Fell God, and it seems to be what the lore means when it says that the Fell God is inside all the giants. This is also apparently what was torn out of the giants and the trolls--the literal eye of their god.
				<br>
				<br>
				Killing the giant opens the path to the Giants' Forge and the Flame of Ruin. When you get there, Melina will appear at your side, thank you, and use herself to kindle the Flame of Ruin to burn the Erdtree. Though, that doesn't have to happen. You might have met someone called Shabriri near where you first entered the Mountaintops of the Giants, who counsels you to find a way to save Melina back in Leyndell. If you follow his advice, you can find a way to kindle the flame yourself, without sacrificing Melina, by giving yourself to the Frenzied Flame.
				<br>
				<br>
				Melina seems okay with fulfilling her purpose and, seemingly, ending her existence, though. As the inhabitants of the Lands Between look on, the Erdtree burns, spreading ash throughout the land. But you soon find yourself awakening somewhere strange--a crumbling mausoleum floating in the clouds. This is Farum Azula, and it's the place where you'll claim the other thing you need to complete the destruction of the Erdtree: Destined Death.
