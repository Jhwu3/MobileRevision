				<p>Having defeated Godrick the Grafted, traveled through Liurnia of the Lakes, and faced the academy of sorcerers, there are two major options facing players in Elden Ring. You can continue to make their way north to the Altus Plateau, home of the foot of the Erdtree, or they can venture east of Limgrave to the festering lands of Caelid. In fact, one of the paths to the Altus Plateau requires you to head to Caelid and fight your way through a fort infested with giant bats. So before moving farther north, we're going to head east to claim a third Great Rune.
				<br>
				<br>
				You can access Caelid pretty early, but it can be a tough place for any Tarnished to survive. That's because Caelid is ravaged by something called Scarlet Rot. The creeping disease infects living things and pools in a huge, fetid swamp, resulting in a whole region filled with putrefying, monstrous creatures. It's also the home of Radahn, one of the demigod children of Radagon and Rennala. The Shardbearer waits for you on the eastern coast of Caelid, but unlike the others, Radahn isn't gathering power or planning to try to become Elden Lord.
				<br>
				<br>
				The reason Caelid is so messed up is because it was the scene of a major turning point in the Shattering, marking the end of most major hostilities and the beginning of the demigods mostly retreating to their lands and strongholds. The Scarlet Rot is the result of a battle between the greatest warriors among the demigod children: Radahn and Malenia. Their clash destroyed Caelid by unleashing the disease, but it also destroyed both Malenia and Radahn. Here's what you need to know about what's happening in Caelid.

				<p>The Shardbearer you're seeking in Caelid is General Radahn, perhaps the fiercest warrior among the demigod children of Marika, with only Malenia able to challenge him for the title. The son of Radagon and Rennala, Radahn is huge and ludicrously strong, sporting red hair like Radagon. He took after both his parents to become a great champion, studying warfare as well as sorcery. Radahn specializes in magic related to gravity, learned in the Caelid sorcerer town of Sellia, which he pursued at least in part so that he could use magic to help his tiny but beloved horse support his enormous body and let him keep riding it. When you finally fight him, you'll see the mountain of a man carried along on a horse that absolutely should have been crushed under his weight.
				<br>
				<br>
				When Radagon was with Rennala, he studied sorcery, and later with Marika studied the incantations of the Golden Order faith. Radahn took at least part of a page from his father, studying to become the strongest warrior he could be, but like Rennala's other children, it seems like Radahn stopped idolizing his father to some degree after he departed Liurnia to return to Leyndell. Instead, Radahn looked to another warrior for inspiration: Godfrey. He leaned hard into a lion motif for his armor and castle, which was a symbol synonymous with the first Elden Lord, with Radahn purposely invoking one of the greatest fighters the Lands Between had ever seen. It's hard to see this as anything other than a slight against Radagon, the second Elden Lord and Godfrey's replacement as Marika's consort.
				<br>
				<br>
				When you finally make your way into the Lands Between, depending on how far you progress in the rest of the game and who you talk to, you might hear about the Radahn Festival. If you've met Iron Fist Alexander, the big living jar, or progressed the quests of Blaidd and Ranni, you'll hear about the festival from them. The festival takes place at Redmane Castle in the southeast of Caelid, and draws Tarnished warriors from all over to take part in it. Radahn's troops are still loyal to him, but as you learn when you reach Redmane, their lord is lost. At this point, everyone who liked the guy just wants him put out of his misery. The festival is now run by a guy called Jerren, who you'll meet at Redmane when you arrive, along with other Tarnished and Blaidd.
