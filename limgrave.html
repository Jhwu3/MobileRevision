				<p>You're one of the Tarnished--a person who died outside the Lands Between but has somehow been beckoned back by "grace," which seems to be the power of the "outer god" known as the Greater Will. In practical terms, some higher power wants you in the Lands Between to enact its will. In fact, there have been lots of Tarnished called to the Lands Between for this job, and all before you have failed. What exactly you're meant to do, however, isn't clear, and you'll hear a whole lot of different interpretations from other characters along the way.
				<br>
				<br>
				Limgrave is a lush, expansive section of the Tenebrae Demesne. Golden trees and tall grass and bushes provide plenty of sustenance for the local wildlife, that features boars, sheep, goat and rodents in addition to flying creatures such as eagles and owls. More sinister and aggressive wildlife also exists, and those venturing forth should be prepared to combat them.

			<h2>Margit the Fell Omen</h2>

				<p>The quest of the Tarnished is to try to repair the broken Elden Ring, and thereby become Elden Lord. To do that, they need at least some of the Great Runes held by the remaining demigods in the Lands Between. That means that, to claim those Great Runes, you'll have to face those demigods in battle, since they're not going to part with their power willingly.
				<br>
				<br>
				In Limgrave, your first logical step is to follow the guidance of grace toward the location to which it is directing you, and with this new information, you now have a better handle on where the guidance is sending you: Stormveil Castle. The lord of the castle, Godrick, is one of the Shardbearers you're searching for. Godrick is a demigod who claimed a Great Rune, so the guidance of grace is directing you to invade the castle and take it from him.
				<br>
				<br>
				Before you reach Godrick or even Stormveil proper, though, you run into another major boss, and possibly the first you fight in the game at all: Margit, the Fell Omen. A great champion of the Golden Order, who fought in the Shattering in service of Leyndell.

			<h2>Godrick the Grafted</h2>
			<img class="contentImage"src="godrick.jpg">
			<div class="text">
				<p>
				Defeating Margit opens the path to the Stormveil castle, and with the help of the castle's gatekeeper, Gostoc--one of the commoners who very much hates his lord, Godrick--you can make your way through a secret entrance. 
				<br>
				<br>
				As you wander Limgrave and the castle, you'll see the results of what Godrick has wrought on the place. His men rule the south of the Lands Between, crucifying people along the roadways and setting up checkpoints at key locations. Soldiers stand at these chokepoints, waiting to attack Tarnished as they cross bridges or pass beneath gatehouses, hunting them and preventing them from reaching Stormveil.
				<br>
				<br>
				When you eventually meet Godrick, you'll learn what grafting is all about: The lord has literally grafted the limbs of other people onto his body, hoping to take their strength into himself. Godrick is covered in extra arms and legs, and Stormveil is full of dismembered bodies from all the people the lord has maimed, tortured, and murdered in order to make himself more powerful.</p>
