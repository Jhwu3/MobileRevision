	<p> 
	It happened an age ago. <br>
	But when I recall, I see it true.
	<br>
	<br>
	On a night of wint'ry fog.
	<br>
	<br>
	The rune of death was stolen <br>
	And the demigods began to fall, starting with Godwyn the Golden.<br>
	Queen Marika was driven to the brink.
	<br>
	<br>
	The Shattering ensued; a war that wrought only darkness.
	<br>
	<br>
	The Elden Ring was broken, but by whom? And why?<br>
	What could the Demigods ever hope to win by warring?
	<br>
	<br>
	The conqueror of the stars, General Radahn. <br>
	And the Blade of Miquella, Malenia the Severed.
	<br>
	<br>
	These two were the mightiest to remain, and locked horns in combat.<br>
	But there would be no victor.
	<br>
	<br>
	And so, we inhabit a fractured world.<br>
	Awaiting the arrival of the Elden Lord.
	<br>
	<br>
	Unless of course, thou shouldst take the crown?

	<p>The Lands Between is the world of Elden Ring, and those who live in The Lands Between were blessed by Grace through the Elden Ring and the Erdtree. Those who were blessed by the Elden Ring are characterized by having a golden aura that can be seen in their eyes. However, at some point, some of those who were blessed lost their grace; they were exiled and labeled the Tarnished.  As time passed, for unknown reasons, the Elden Ring was shattered and its shards were scattered across the Lands Between. The largest of these pieces were called Great Runes and were claimed by the six Demigod children of Queen Marika the Eternal (The previous ruler of these lands), causing them to inherit different powers and have been physically changed and twisted due to being corrupted by the power of these runes.</p>

	<div class ="text">
	<p>The Lands Between is divided into 6 major areas:</p>
