				<p>Liurnia is a huge marsh more than it is a lake, and warfare has seen its towns sink into the water and mud beneath. In addition to the battles of the Shattering, the nation has also suffered significantly from civil war. There are two major political forces in Liurnia that have been at odds, and the result is that there are two major players, a demigod and a Shardbearer, holed up in their respective fortifications, but for very different reasons.
				<br>
				<br>
				At the center of Liurnia is Raya Lucaria, a sorcery academy, while the north is the home of the Carian royal family in Caria Manor. These are two separate powers, although they were once allied: the Carians are the traditional royal family of Liurnia, and Rennala, the last of the Carian royal line, is a powerful sorcerer and formerly the head of Raya Lucaria. But a lot has happened since then.
				<br>
				<br>
				Back when Marika was chosen by the Greater Will to become a god, the Lands Between were home to several nations of several different kinds of people. Liurnia, home of sorcerers who valued intelligence over faith and drew power from the cosmos to create their magic, had monarchs of its own in the Carian royals. Rennala was a powerful sorcerer and champion in her youth, and her prowess caused the academy to name her its master, in addition to being queen. Under her leadership, Liurnia resisted the Golden Order, which prompted Marika to dispatch her own champion, Radagon, at the head of an army. Still, the Carians and their sorcery-adept knights held back the Golden Order forces despite much smaller numbers.

				<p>The guidance of grace in Liurnia directs you toward Raya Lucaria so that you can claim the Great Rune held by Rennala. Inside, you'll find various sorcerers and some Albinaurics who seem to serve them. Also within and around the academy are other signs of its power. Soldiers marching toward the academy from the north are intercepted by magical projections and multi-armed mechanical marionettes, brought to life through sorcery. The sorcerers have a lot of power at their disposal, it seems, and continue to study the stars and the cosmos to increase their knowledge, while foregoing faith in the Outer Gods.
				<br>
				<br>
				Moving deeper into the academy, you'll find something else that's curious: a mechanized contraption on wheels shaped like an iron maiden. This is an Abductor Virgin, and you can find a couple of them marauding around the grounds of the academy. They have their ties to Mt. Gelmir, a volcano north of Liurnia, where Rykard is lord. The "abductor" part of the name Abductor Virgin is important here, as these contraptions are apparently capturing and carrying off Albinaurics. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Your path takes you to the great library in the highest part of the academy, where Rennala is imprisoned, and where you fight her as a boss. Though her children are demigods, Rennala is not--although her Great Rune means she is a Shardbearer. However, when you get there, you find that Rennala is not really all there. Her broken heart seems to have driven her mad, and she's used her Great Rune egg to create a bunch of creepy scholar children who crawl around and sing to her. They're similar to Albinaurics, but don't seem to be exactly the same thing; these are the imperfect "born again" creatures Rennala can create with her Great Rune, which apparently don't live for very long. The reborn scholars use magic to attack you and protect Rennala, but they're weak and easily defeated.
